# Encoding Temporal Features (Part 2)
## How to teach public holidays to Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
---
It's quite common to see seasonality patterns in time series data. Sometimes they are short term like the number of customers in a retail store which varies within a regular week. And sometimes they are long term seasonality like the average temperature per day or the number of visitors in cinemas which decreases during summer time.
In the last blog post, we have seen a way to cope with short term effects by encoding the calendar_dt into features, which can even handle public holidays. In this blog post I'd like to focus on handling long term seasonality.



# Common Approaches
Because seasonality are quite frequent in time series ,there exists already several way
